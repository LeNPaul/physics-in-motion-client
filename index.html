    <p>
      In a similar manner, if we wish to build a Solar System from scratch, 
      we must first start with the fundamental concepts and building blocks. 
      Short of inventing the universe, we will start with the study of motion. 
      Namely, we will start with the mathematical tools that we use to describe 
      the motion of a body.
    </p>

    <h5 class="pt-3">Describing Bodies on Axes</h5>

    <p>
      To more easily describe the motion of objects that we are studying, 
      we simplfiy the object by imagining that the object - regardless of 
      its size or shape - is a tiny particle that we treat as a single point. 
      For describing the position in one dimension, we imagine that the particle 
      is sitting in a coordinate system, where the position of the particle can 
      be anywhere along a line that we call an axis, with respect to an arbitrary 
      point that we call the origin. The origin is considered the zero point, and 
      the number of units from the origin to the object on the axis is used to 
      represent the position of that point on the axis.
    </p>
    
    <div class="d-flex justify-content-center" id="one-dimensional-position"></div>

    <p>
      In two dimensions, we simply add another axis. Typically, they are called 
      the x and y axes. If we wanted to track the position of an object in three 
      dimensions, we could add another axis. For simplicity, we will focus on 
      two dimensions for now, but many of the same concepts can easily be extended 
      to three dimensions.
    </p>

    <div class="d-flex justify-content-center" id="two-dimensional-position"></div>

    <h5 class="pt-3">Coordinate Systems</h5>

    <p>
      In physics, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system" 
      class="text-dark">Cartesian coordinate system</a> is used to specify the position 
      of objects in space over time. We can directly plot the motion of an object in two 
      dimensions on a coordinate system, where the x and y axes are perpendicular to each 
      other and each represent a plane of motion.
    </p>

    <div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><canvas id="myChart1" width="400" height="200"></canvas></div>

    <h5 class="pt-3">Graphing the Position of an Object in Time</h5>
    
    <p>
      Motion, however, implies that time is moving forward. How do we represent time going forward? 
      In the above graph, it was implied that time was increasing and that the object was moving along 
      the plotted path as time increased. We can represent this in a graph, where in one dimension, 
      the x-axis represents time, while the y-axis represents position with respect to the 
      origin. At any point in time along the x-axis, there is a corresponding point on the 
      y-axis that represents the distance of that object from the origin.
    </p>


    <p>
      The following chart describes the motion of an object in one dimension, the very first 
      visualization shown. Between 0 - 4 time units, the object is moving away from the origin 
      until it reaches a posiiton of 4 units to the right. Between 4 - 8 time units, the object 
      moves towards the origin, and we see the graph slopes downwards until it reaches position 0.
    </p>

    <canvas id="myChart2" width="400" height="200"></canvas>

    <h5 class="pt-3">The Position Function</h5>

    <p>
      Tying this all together, we can describe the position of a particle in one dimension 
      at a given time using a single function - called the position function - that we represent 
      with the symbol \( p(t) \), where \( t \) refers to the time, and \( p \) refers to the 
      position of the particle relative to the origin at the given time.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      $$ p(t) = position $$
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Looking at the above chart, we can come up with an equation that can be used to describe 
      the motion of the object.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Between time 0 - 4, we can use the following equation:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      $$ p(t) = t $$
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Between time 4 - 8, we can use the following equation:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      $$ p(t) = 8 - t $$
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We can validate this ourselves by substituting \( t \) into any of the above equations, 
      using the correct function for a given time, and see that we get the correct position on 
      the graph.
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, the motion of an object in two-dimensions can be described by two position functions. 
      For example, \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \), for the x-axis and the y-axis, respectively. We call 
      this the Cartesian coordinate system, where the position of a particle is defined on the Cartesian 
      plane.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If we know what \( p(t) \) is as a function, then we know everything we need to know about 
      the motion of the particle, as we will see in later sections.
    </p>

    <!--
    <p>
      All bodies of mass have gravitational attraction to each other. 
      However, the force of attraction is typically too small to perceive 
      on the kinds of scales that we are used to. When objects start to get 
      to the size of planets, they will exert gravitational forces on each other, 
      causing them to orbit each other in space.
    </p>
  
      <div class="d-flex justify-content-center" id="two-body"></div>

    <p>
      When there is a single central body that has significantly more mass 
      than the other objects, we can leave out the gravitational forces of 
      attraction between the smaller objects and focus only on the gravitational 
      force of attraction between the central mass and the orbiting planets.
    </p>
